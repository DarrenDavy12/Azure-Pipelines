# Configure YAML pipeline trigger


First I changed my trigger, referenced my branch of my repo under trigger in my YAML file for the pipeline then hit save:

The pipeline is also one of the files in the branch which we I save the pipeline I am changing the branch. 

Notice I did not run the pipeline just simply saved the changes without running and it triggered because of the changes been made. 

I made a new window for pipeline to see running changes and it was successful:
